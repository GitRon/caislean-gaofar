            **About Windows Defender**: This build has been optimized to reduce false positives from antivirus software by:
            - Using directory-based distribution (--onedir) instead of self-extracting archives
            - Disabling UPX compression which is often flagged as suspicious
            - Including Windows executable metadata (version info, company, copyright)

            If Windows Defender or other antivirus software still flags the executable, this is a false positive. The executable is safe to run. You can verify the source code is open and auditable in this repository.
